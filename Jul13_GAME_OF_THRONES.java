door

The king wants to lock the door so that the Dothraki canâ€™t enter. But, to lock the door you need a key that is a palindrome of an anagram of a certain string.

The king has a list of words. For each given word, can you help the king in figuring out if any anagram of it can be a palindrome or not?.

Input Format
A single line which will contain the input string

Constraints
1<=length of string <= 10^5 Each character of the string is a lowercase english alphabet.

Output Format
A single line containing YES/NO in capital letter of english alphabet.

aaabbbb
Sample Output : 01

YES
Explanation
One of the permutations of the given string which is a palindrome is bbaaabb. 

Sample Input : 02

cdefghmnopqrstuvw
Sample Output : 02

NO
Explanation
You can verify that no permutation of the given string can be a palindrome. 

Sample Input : 03

cdcdcdcdeeeef
